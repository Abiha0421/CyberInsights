    <div class="content">
        <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
        <p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers impersonate trustworthy entities to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or other personal data. This is often done via fake emails, websites, or messages that appear legitimate.</p>

        <h2>Common Types of Phishing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Phishing:</strong> Fake emails that appear to be from trusted organizations, asking for sensitive information or prompting the victim to click on malicious links.</li>
            <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> Targeted phishing attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations using personal information to make the attack more convincing.</li>
            <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> Phishing attacks conducted via SMS messages that lure victims into sharing sensitive data or clicking malicious links.</li>
            <li><strong>Vishing:</strong> Phishing attacks carried out through voice calls, where attackers pretend to be legitimate authorities or organizations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Identify Phishing Attempts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Look for generic greetings like "Dear Customer" instead of your name.</li>
            <li>Check for grammatical errors or inconsistencies in the message.</li>
            <li>Hover over links to verify the URL before clicking. Beware of links that look legitimate but lead to suspicious sites.</li>
            <li>Beware of urgent or threatening language urging immediate action.</li>
            <li>Verify the sender's email address for signs of impersonation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Examples of Phishing Scams</h2>
        <div class="examples">
            <p><strong>Fake Bank Notification:</strong> An email claiming to be from your bank, asking you to log in to "secure your account." The link redirects you to a fake login page that steals your credentials.</p>
            <p><strong>Online Shopping Scam:</strong> A message from an "online retailer" about a supposed issue with your recent order, prompting you to enter payment details on a fraudulent site.</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Support Scam:</strong> A pop-up or email claiming your device has been compromised and urging you to call a "support" number where attackers attempt to gain access to your system.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Protect Yourself Against Phishing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all accounts.</li>
            <li>Use strong, unique passwords for each account and update them regularly.</li>
            <li>Be cautious about clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</li>
            <li>Regularly update your software and security settings to protect against vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Educate yourself and others about the risks of phishing and how to recognize it.</li>
        </ul>
